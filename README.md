<h1 align="center">🌌 THE VOYAGE</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>An immersive, retro-future digital bridge across 9,999km.</b><br>
  Built with high-end animations and interactive storytelling to bridge the gap between two points in space.

## 🛰️ INTRODUCTION
**The Voyage** is a digital "love letter" designed as a dedicated connection portal. It gamifies the concept of **"Syncing"** across vast distances. Users must navigate a Synthwave landscape—tuning frequencies, collecting data packets, and generating power—to unlock a final encrypted message.

### ⚡ PERSONALIZE THE TRANSMISSION
To target a specific recipient and unlock the custom terminal greeting, you must inject a **Name Parameter** into the connection string.

| **ACTION** | **INSTRUCTION** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | Copy your deployment URL |
| **Step 2** | Append `?n=Name` to the end of the address |

<br>

`mayborg121.github.io/voyage`**`?n=Person's Name`**

`Example : `**`mayborg121.github.io/voyage?n=Mayur`**

<p>
  <sub><i>The UI will dynamically reconfigure its terminal logs to address the specified user.</i></sub>
