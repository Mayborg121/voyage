**The Voyage** is an immersive, gamified web experience built with a Retro-Future/Synthwave aesthetic. It combines high-end web animations with interactive storytelling to bridge the digital gap between two points in space.

## 🚀 Purpose
This project was designed as a digital "love letter" or a dedicated connection portal. It gamifies the concept of "Syncing" across a vast distance (9,999km). Users must interact with various retro-inspired UI elements—tuning frequencies, collecting data packets, and generating power—to unlock a final encrypted message.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The project is built with a focus on high performance and smooth visual fidelity:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Design System)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid utility-based layout.
* **Animations:** [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for:
    * **ScrollTrigger:** For scroll-bound parallax and sun movement.
    * **Timeline:** For the final "Sync" sequence.
* **Visual Effects:** Custom CRT scanline overlays, flickering animations, and CSS perspective-warping for the 3D retro-grid.
